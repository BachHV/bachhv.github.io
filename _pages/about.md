I am an undergraduate studying Math and Computer Science at UIUC. My research interest lies in Formal Methods, Automated Reasoning, and Automated Theorem Proving. I'm also exploring topics, both theoretical and applications, such as Computational Complexity (Algebraic Complexity, Proof Complexity), Quantum Computing, Cryptography, Security.
